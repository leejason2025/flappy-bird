# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Flappy Bird clone game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The game will feature a bird that the player controls by clicking or pressing keys to navigate through pipes, with scoring based on successfully passing through pipe gaps.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Bird Control and Physics

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control a bird that responds to my input and falls due to gravity, so that I can navigate through the game world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the bird SHALL be positioned in the center-left of the screen
2. WHEN the player clicks or presses spacebar THEN the bird SHALL jump upward with a fixed velocity
3. WHEN no input is provided THEN the bird SHALL continuously fall downward due to gravity
4. WHEN the bird reaches the top or bottom of the screen THEN the game SHALL end
5. IF the bird is falling THEN the bird SHALL rotate slightly downward to show falling motion
6. IF the bird is jumping THEN the bird SHALL rotate slightly upward to show upward motion

### Requirement 2: Pipe Generation and Movement

**User Story:** As a player, I want pipes to continuously appear and move across the screen, so that I have obstacles to navigate through.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN pipes SHALL spawn from the right side of the screen at regular intervals
2. WHEN pipes are active THEN they SHALL move from right to left at a constant speed
3. WHEN a pipe exits the left side of the screen THEN it SHALL be removed from the game
4. IF pipes are generated THEN each pipe pair SHALL have a random vertical gap position
5. IF pipes are generated THEN the gap between top and bottom pipes SHALL be consistent and passable
6. WHEN pipes are displayed THEN they SHALL extend from the top and bottom of the screen with a gap in between

### Requirement 3: Collision Detection

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to detect when my bird hits pipes or boundaries, so that the game ends appropriately when I fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bird touches any pipe THEN the game SHALL end immediately
2. WHEN the bird touches the top boundary THEN the game SHALL end immediately
3. WHEN the bird touches the bottom boundary THEN the game SHALL end immediately
4. IF collision occurs THEN the bird SHALL stop moving and the game loop SHALL pause
5. WHEN collision is detected THEN a game over state SHALL be triggered

### Requirement 4: Scoring System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to earn points by successfully navigating through pipes, so that I can track my performance and try to beat my high score.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bird successfully passes through a pipe gap THEN the score SHALL increase by 1 point
2. WHEN the game is active THEN the current score SHALL be displayed on screen
3. WHEN the game ends THEN the final score SHALL be prominently displayed
4. IF a new high score is achieved THEN it SHALL be stored and displayed
5. WHEN the game restarts THEN the score SHALL reset to 0

### Requirement 5: Game States and Flow

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear game states with start, play, and game over screens, so that I understand the game flow and can restart easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the game SHALL display a start screen with instructions
2. WHEN the player provides input on the start screen THEN the game SHALL begin
3. WHEN the game is active THEN all game elements SHALL update and render continuously
4. WHEN collision occurs THEN the game SHALL transition to a game over state
5. WHEN in game over state THEN the player SHALL be able to restart the game
6. IF the game restarts THEN all game elements SHALL reset to initial positions

### Requirement 6: Visual Rendering and Animation

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth visual feedback and animations, so that the game feels responsive and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN all elements SHALL render at 60 frames per second
2. WHEN elements move THEN they SHALL appear smooth without flickering
3. WHEN the bird jumps THEN there SHALL be visual feedback showing the action
4. WHEN pipes move THEN they SHALL maintain consistent speed and spacing
5. IF the game state changes THEN visual elements SHALL update immediately
6. WHEN rendering occurs THEN the canvas SHALL be cleared and redrawn each frame

### Requirement 7: Input Handling

**User Story:** As a player, I want multiple input methods to control the bird, so that I can play the game comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player clicks the mouse THEN the bird SHALL jump
2. WHEN the player presses the spacebar THEN the bird SHALL jump
3. WHEN the player presses the up arrow key THEN the bird SHALL jump
4. IF multiple inputs occur rapidly THEN only one jump action SHALL be processed per input
5. WHEN the game is in start or game over state THEN input SHALL trigger appropriate state transitions
